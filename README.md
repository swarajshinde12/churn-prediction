Customer Churn Prediction System

Desktop-Based Machine Learning Application

Overview

The Customer Churn Prediction System is a desktop-based machine learning application designed to predict whether a customer is likely to leave a service based on historical customer data. The application provides an offline graphical user interface (GUI) where users can upload a CSV dataset and receive predictions, evaluation metrics, and visual insights generated by a pre-trained machine learning model.

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data science workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment in a standalone desktop application.

Objectives

Predict customer churn using machine learning

Build a reusable and deployable ML pipeline

Provide a user-friendly desktop interface

Display evaluation metrics and visual explanations

Enable offline execution without web frameworks

Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical business problem, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By predicting churn in advance, businesses can take preventive actions such as targeted marketing, personalized offers, or customer engagement strategies.

This project aims to develop a predictive system that identifies customers at risk of churn and presents the results in an understandable and visual manner for both technical and non-technical users.
